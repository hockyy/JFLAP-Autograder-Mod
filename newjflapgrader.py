def parse_test_file_contents(contents):
    r"""Parses the contents of a JFLAP test file.

    The contents of the test file should be provided as a multiline
    string. This function will parse the string and return a
    dictionary mapping input strings to boolean values, with False
    meaning that the input should be rejected by the NFA or Turing
    machine and True meaning that the input should be accepted by the
    NFA or Turing machine.

    The test file may contain test cases and function definitions.
    Syntactically, a test case is a sequence of whitespace-delimited
    tokens on a single line. All whitespace is ignored, except to
    determine where to split the line into tokens. However, you may
    use double or single quotes to group tokens together. This way,
    you can include whitespace inside a single token. A token boundary
    always occurs directly before and after a pair of quotes. Note
    that you can also include quotes of the same type by escaping them
    with a backslash, and backslashes in the same way. Those are the
    only allowed backslash escapes. Note that backslash escapes are
    unnecessary except in quoted tokens.

    Test files may contain comments. If a line starts with an
    octothorpe (#), discounting leading whitespace, then it is
    ignored. If you wish for the first token to begin with an
    octothorpe, quote it. Note that there is no support for
    end-of-line comments. Comments must begin at the beginning of
    lines.

    All but the first and last tokens of a test case are ignored. You
    may use intermediate tokens to improve the appearance and
    readability of the test cases (for instance, by including an arrow
    "->"). The first token is the input string for the NFA or Turing
    machine, and the last token is a word identifying whether it
    should be accepted or rejected. The input string can contain any
    characters (other than, of course, newline characters), and the
    accept/reject word can be any prefix of any of the keys in
    "result_words", as long as it does not match two words with
    opposite meanings. (This is not possible with the current value of
    "result_words", but it might become possible if the dictionary is
    broadened in future.) Note that you can provide a test case for
    the empty string using an empty pair of quotes ("").

    If only one token is provided, it is assumed to be the input
    string and the accept/reject value of the test case is left
    undefined, to be determined by the "check" function or to default
    to "accept" if "check" is not defined. If no tokens are provided,
    then the line must be whitespace-only, and it is skipped.

    At any point in the test file, you may define a function of one
    argument called "check", a function of no arguments called
    "words", both, or neither. These are standard Python functions.
    You must use at least four-space indentation in function
    definitions, and they cannot contain any lines with only
    whitespace. In both "words" and "check", you will have access to
    the function "all_bitstrings" defined above.

    If you define "words", then it is called to obtain an iterable of
    input strings that will be used as test cases in addition to those
    explicitly specified in the file. These generated test cases will
    not have information about whether they should be rejected or
    accepted, so if you do not define "check" or also specify the test
    cases and their desired results explicitly in the test file, then
    they will default to "accept" for reasons of reverse
    compatibility.

    If you define "check", then it is called with any input strings
    for which you did not provide a result keyword, as well as any
    input strings generated by "words" for which a result keyword is
    not also provided in the explicit test cases, in order to
    determine the intended result for the input string (logical true
    meaning accept or and logical false meaning reject).

    This version of the function is completely reverse compatible with
    old-style test files, with the aid of a CSS-like "quirks mode".
