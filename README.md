**JFLAP Autograder**: hopefully faster than running JFLAP tests by
hand.

## Instructions

* Put your student submission files (`.jff`) in the `submissions`
  directory, creating it if absent.
* Put your tests in the `tests` file, creating it if absent. Refer to
  the docstring in `jflapgrader.py` for information about the format,
  which is comically absurd in its flexibility and power.
* Run `testdirectory.py`. This will take a while, and will tell you as
  submissions are graded.
* Run `format_results.py`. Adjust grading metrics and output format to
  taste.
